PLANETARY GENERATION SYSTEM - DETAILED REQUIREMENTS
1. CORE GENERATION - ORE PLACEMENT ISSUE

Problem: Ores are not generating inside planets during world generation
Requirement: Ores must generate throughout the entire planetary volume, not just on the surface
Implementation needed: Proper ore distribution system that places ores at various depths within the planet's interior based on the planet type and composition

2. PLANET DIVERSITY - EXTREME VARIETY

Current Problem: Planet types are too uniform and repetitive - all planets look identical
Required Diversity:

Block variety: Planets should use many different block types with unique combinations
Shape variety: Planets should have diverse shapes (spherical, elliptical, irregular, cratered, fractured, etc.)
Type variety: Completely different planet categories (rocky, gaseous, crystalline, metallic, ice, lava, corrupted, alien biomes, etc.)
Target: At least 2,000+ unique combinations and variations possible
Each planet should feel unique with its own characteristics, colors, and terrain features



3. ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS & IMMERSIVE FEATURES

Toxic atmospheres: Some planets should have poisonous/hazardous atmospheres with visual effects
Particle effects: Glowing particles, dust clouds, fog, radiation shimmer, energy fields
Environmental hazards: Damage over time on hostile planets, visibility reduction, status effects
Visual atmosphere: Use all available Minecraft particle and shader effects to create immersive planetary atmospheres
Lighting effects: Unique ambient lighting for each planet type (red glow for lava planets, blue shimmer for ice planets, etc.)

4. GENERATION PROGRESS & TELEPORTATION

Progress indicator: Display generation percentage during planet creation (e.g., "Generating Planet... 47%")
Teleportation fix: When a planet finishes generating, teleport the player to the first generated block of the planet's surface, NOT into mid-air
Safe landing: Ensure player spawns on solid ground, not floating or falling

5. COMPREHENSIVE CONFIGURATION SYSTEM

Current Problem: Config file is not customizable enough
Requirement: Config must expose ALL possible settings:

Planet size ranges (min/max)
Generation frequency and rarity
Ore distribution settings
Biome weights and probabilities
Structure generation rates
Atmospheric effect toggles
Performance options (generation speed, chunk loading)
Distance between planets
Spawn rules and restrictions
Loot table customization
Enable/disable specific planet types
Custom block palettes for each planet type



6. CONTEXTUAL LOOT & STRUCTURES

Problem: Treasure chests and structures are currently random
Requirement: Loot and structures must be biome-specific and contextual:

Ice planets → Ice-themed structures, cold-resistant gear, frost-related items
Lava planets → Heat-resistant materials, obsidian tools, fire-related loot
Desert planets → Sand-based structures, survival supplies, ancient artifacts
Each planet type should have unique structure sets that fit its theme
Loot tables should match the environment (no wood chests on metal planets, etc.)



7. HOLLOW PLANETS & INTERIOR CONTENT

Both types needed:

Solid planets: Standard generation with ores throughout
Hollow planets: Empty interior with accessible cave systems


Hollow planet features:

Tunnel networks: Complex cave systems leading to the interior
Interior structures: Ancient ruins, abandoned bases, alien architectures
Abandoned civilization feel: Should feel like someone once lived there
Minecraft structure integration: Use existing Minecraft structures (villages, temples, fortresses, etc.) adapted to the planet's biome theme
Interior biomes: Unique underground ecosystems inside hollow planets
Lighting: Natural light sources like glowing crystals, lava pools, or bioluminescent blocks



8. VEGETATION & DECORATION PLACEMENT

Critical fix: Trees, grass, flowers, and other decorations MUST NOT generate floating in the air
Ground contact required: All vegetation must be placed on solid ground blocks
Validation check: Before placing any decorative feature, verify there is a solid block beneath it
Natural placement: Follow Minecraft's natural generation rules for vegetation

9. ORBITAL FEATURES - MOONS, RINGS & ASTEROIDS

Planetary satellites: Planets should have moons/satellites orbiting around them

Small moons for some planets
Multiple moon systems for larger planets
Moons should be explorable and have their own unique properties


Planetary rings: Some planets should have ring systems (like Saturn)

Made of asteroids, ice, or debris
Visually striking and particle-enhanced
Can be navigated through


Asteroid belts: Clusters of asteroids around or near planets

Mineable resources
Different asteroid compositions (metal, ice, stone)
Create natural navigation challenges


Atmospheric glow: Enhanced brightness and particle effects around planets to make them visually stand out in space
Dynamic lighting: Planets should emit light based on their type (lava planets glow red, ice planets have a cool blue shimmer)
