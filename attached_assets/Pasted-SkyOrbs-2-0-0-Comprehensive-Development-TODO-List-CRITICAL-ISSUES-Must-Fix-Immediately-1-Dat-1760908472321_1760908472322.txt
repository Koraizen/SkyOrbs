SkyOrbs 2.0.0 - Comprehensive Development TODO List
ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)
1. Database Schema Missing Critical Columns

Problem: DatabaseManager.java doesn't store new Orb features (paletteId, modifiers, atmosphere, planetType, coreLevel, etc.)
Impact: Data loss on server restart - all advanced features will be lost
Action Items:

 Add database migration system
 Add columns: palette_id TEXT, modifiers TEXT (JSON), atmosphere TEXT, planet_type TEXT
 Add columns: core_level INTEGER, energy_level REAL, xp BIGINT, biosphere_level INTEGER, ecological_balance REAL
 Create migration script for existing databases
 Add versioning system to track schema changes
 Implement JSON serialization for Set<PlanetModifier>



2. Ore Generation Integration Issues

Problem: OreGenerator.tryGenerateOre() uses biome name but config uses planet types
Impact: Ore generation will fail for most planets - mismatch between BiomeType and PlanetType
Action Items:

 Create mapping between BiomeType and PlanetType
 Add fallback ore profiles for unmapped biomes
 Standardize naming convention (either all BiomeType or all PlanetType)
 Add config validation on startup to detect missing mappings
 Create default ore profile that applies when no specific profile exists



3. Hollow Planet Ore Spawn Conflict

Problem: generateSolidPlanet() integrates ores, but hollow planets skip this entirely
Impact: Hollow planets will have NO ores even if config allows it
Action Items:

 Move tryGenerateOre() to separate method called by both solid and hollow generation
 Implement shell-specific ore generation for hollow planets
 Add config option hollowPlanetOreMultiplier for shell ore density
 Test ore distribution in shell vs solid core



4. Missing Atmosphere Registration

Problem: Atmosphere is selected and stored but never registered with AtmosphereManager
Impact: Atmospheric effects won't work on planets
Action Items:

 Add atmosphereManager.registerPlanetAtmosphere(orb.getId(), atmosphere) after planet creation
 Load atmospheres from database on plugin startup
 Add atmosphere persistence in DatabaseManager
 Implement atmosphere cleanup on planet deletion



5. Progress Tracking Math Error

Problem: Progress steps are hardcoded but actual generation steps vary (asteroids/satellites optional)
Impact: Progress bar will show incorrect percentages
Action Items:

 Implement dynamic step calculation based on enabled features
 Create ProgressTracker class with addStep(), completeStep() methods
 Calculate total steps at generation start based on config
 Handle optional features (asteroids, satellites, rings) gracefully



6. Palette System Not Used Correctly

Problem: Palette is selected but generateSolidPlanet() only uses it for surface - subsurface uses biome
Impact: Inconsistent block composition, reduces palette diversity benefit
Action Items:

 Refactor material selection to fully use palette system
 Remove biome-based material selection from planet generation
 Ensure palette provides materials for all depth levels
 Add palette previews to admin GUI



ðŸŸ  HIGH PRIORITY (Performance & Stability)
7. Memory Leak in PlacementService

Problem: reservedLocations Set grows indefinitely, releaseLocation() only called on success
Impact: Memory leak over time, especially with failed generations
Action Items:

 Implement timeout-based cleanup (remove reservations after 5 minutes)
 Use ConcurrentHashMap with timestamp values
 Add scheduled task to clean stale reservations
 Always call releaseLocation() in finally block (already done, but verify all paths)
 Add metrics tracking for reserved locations count



8. Thread Pool Shutdown Issues

Problem: GenerationManager.shutdown() uses 5-second timeout - may lose data if tasks are running
Impact: Incomplete planet generation on server stop
Action Items:

 Increase shutdown timeout to 30 seconds
 Implement graceful degradation (save partial progress)
 Add generation state tracking (PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
 Store generation state in database for resume on restart
 Add admin command to view/cancel active generations



9. Chunk Loading Race Conditions

Problem: placeBlocksInBatches() loads chunks but doesn't wait for completion
Impact: Blocks may fail to place if chunks aren't loaded yet
Action Items:

 Use CompletableFuture for chunk loading
 Wait for all chunks to load before starting batch placement
 Add retry logic for failed block placements
 Implement chunk load verification
 Add configurable chunk load timeout



10. Concurrent Modification in Shape Weights

Problem: shapeWeightsCache can be modified while being read (no synchronization)

 Use Collections.unmodifiableMap() for returned map
 Add read-write lock if needed
 Test with concurrent planet generations



11. Missing Error Handling in Async Operations

Action Items:

 Add .exceptionally() handlers to all CompletableFutures
 Send error messages to players on failure
 Log detailed error information
 Implement automatic cleanup on failure (remove partial planet)
 Add generation failure metrics



ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Features & Polish)

Action Items:

 Implement spatial partitioning for structure placement
 Add collision detection between structures
 Ensure structures don't intersect with tunnels
 Add minimum distance between structures
 Implement structure rotation for variety



13. Dungeon Loot ItemStack Amount Bug

Problem: Fixed with Math.max(1, amount) but root cause (random can be 0) not addressed

 Ensure min parameter is always >= 1 in loot generation
 Refactor all loot generation to use utility method
 Add unit tests for loot amount generation
 Validate config loot amounts on startup

 Cache surface height map during planet generation
 Use heightmap data structure for O(1) lookups
 Skip tree generation if no ground found after 10 checks
 Add config option for tree search optimization level

Action Items:

 Consider using Guice or simple DI pattern
 Pass dependencies through constructors
 Remove static getInstance() calls from business logic
 Make classes testable with mock dependencies
 Refactor gradually (high effort, low priority)
